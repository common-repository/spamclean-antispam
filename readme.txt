== Frequently Asked Questions ==
What database do you use to consider comment a spam?
There are two kinds of databases we use to mark the comment as a spam:
 - Public database 
 - Local database

For the public database, we use an external service StopForumSpam (http://www.stopforumspam.com/) and for the local database, we use your own comment database. Every comment that is marked as spam by you on your website/blog we keep a record of that and analyse future comments based on that.

These features are both optional and can be adjusted from the "Basic Settings" page on the plugin.
